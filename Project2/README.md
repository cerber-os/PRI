# Project 2

Create program computing simple operations on small square matrices, such as:
  - addition
  - subtraction
  - multiplication
  - calculating determinant

Elements of matrix should be read from user interactively. Program should allow editting already entered data, print them in readable form and provide simple text menu.

**Build:**
```sh
$ make
```
or
```sh
$ gcc -o MatrixCalculator -O2 -Wall --std=c99 $(ls *.c)
```

**Note:** Entry point of program is located in file ```MatricCalculator.c```
